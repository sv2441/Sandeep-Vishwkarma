Optimization techniques in neural networks refer to the algorithms and methods used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of training a neural network. 
### Here are some of the most commonly used optimization techniques:

# 1. Gradient Descent

## Definition: 
Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the loss function of a neural network by adjusting the weights and biases of the model in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss.

## Advantages:

1) Simple and widely used
2) Can be used for both small and large datasets
3) Can be combined with other optimization techniques
## Disadvantages:

1) Can be prone to getting stuck in local minima
2) Can be slow to converge on high-dimensional and 3) non-convex loss functions

# 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Definition: 
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a variation of Gradient Descent that updates the weights and biases of the model based on a small subset of the training data (a mini-batch) at each iteration.

## Advantages:

1) Faster convergence than standard Gradient Descent
2) Can handle large datasets and online learning
3) Reduces the risk of getting stuck in local minima
## Disadvantages:

1) Can be sensitive to the learning rate and batch size
2) Can suffer from noisy updates

# 3. Adam Optimizer
## Definition: 
Adam Optimizer is a popular stochastic optimization algorithm that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter in the model.

## Advantages:

1) Efficient and requires less memory than other optimization algorithms
2) Can handle noisy and sparse gradients
3) Converges quickly on a wide range of problems
## Disadvantages:

1) Can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters
2) Can converge to suboptimal solutions on non-convex problems

# 4. Adagrad
## Definition: 
Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate of each parameter based on the historical gradients of that parameter.

## Advantages:

1) Automatically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter
2) Can handle sparse data and noisy gradients
3) Converges quickly on problems with a small number of parameters

## Disadvantages:

1) Can suffer from slow convergence on problems with a large number of parameters
2) Can accumulate too much learning rate, leading to numerical instability

# 5. RMSprop
## Definition: 
RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that uses a moving average of the squared gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

## Advantages:

1) Efficient and easy to implement
2) Converges quickly on a wide range of problems
3) Handles non-stationary environments well
## Disadvantages:

1) Can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters
2) Can suffer from noisy and sparse gradients

# 6. AdaDelta
## Definition: 
AdaDelta is an extension of Adagrad that adapts the learning rate based on a moving average of the recent gradients.

## Advantages:

1) Requires fewer hyperparameters than other optimization algorithms
2) Can handle sparse data and noisy gradients
3) Converges quickly on a wide range of problems
## Disadvantages:

1) Can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters
2) Can suffer from slow convergence on problems with a large number of parameters

Overall, the choice of optimization technique depends on the specific problem and dataset, and it is often necessary to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
